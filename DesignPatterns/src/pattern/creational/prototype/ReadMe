The prototype means making a clone. This implies cloning of an object to avoid creation. If the cost of creating a new object is large and creation is resource intensive, we clone the object. We use the interface Cloneable and call its method clone() to clone the object.

Again let’s try and understand this with the help of a non-software example. I am stressing on general examples throughout this write-up because I find them easy to understand and easy to accept as we all read and see them in day-to-day activity. The example here we will take will be of a plant cell. This example is a bit different from the actual cloning in a way that cloning involves making a copy of the original one. Here, we break the cell in two and make two copies and the original one does not exist. But, this example will serve the purpose. Let’s say the Mitotic Cell Division in plant cells.
Let’s take a class PlantCell having a method split(). The plant cell will implement the interface Cloneable.
