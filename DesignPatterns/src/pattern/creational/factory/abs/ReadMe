This pattern is one level of abstraction higher than factory pattern. 
This means that the abstract factory returns the factory of classes. 
Like Factory pattern returned one of the several sub-classes, 
this returns such factory which later will return one of the sub-classes.

Let’s understand this pattern with the help of an example.

Suppose we need to get the specification of various parts of a computer based 
on which work the computer will be used for.

The different parts of computer are, say Monitor, RAM and Processor. 
The different types of computers are PC, Workstation and Server.
